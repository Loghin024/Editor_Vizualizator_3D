# 3DEngine
This project is a **3D engine** developed from 0 with C++ and a **2D** -  library SFML. Application allows users to **create** complex 3d objects using small predefined components(cubes, pyramids, spheres, cones, prisms etc) and to **edit** them(change position in space, dimensions etc).

The user can create numerous projects and save them into his computer, accesing or deleting them whenever he wants. 


## Instructions
**Camera controls:**

**W** - forward

**S** - down

**A** - left

**D** - right

**Q** - up

**A** - down

**Mouse** - change camera angle

**Other controls:**

**O** - open editor/close view mode

**C** - close view mode/ open editor

## Usage/Examples

**Main menu:**

From this page user can create a new project, change the language, open existing project or close the app.

**Editor**

Using the left side, user can select the figure he wants to add in his workspace and after selecting it he needs to fill a formular with figure's details, such as coordinates, size, etc.
Using the right side, user can edit the figure he added by simply searching after the name he gave to the component(the list on the upper right side displays all existing figures) and clicking on it. After that, the user can select which detail he wants to change(X-Position, Y-Position, Z-Position, different sizes of the component, etc). 

**UP - ARROW** - increases selected detail

**DOWN - ARROW** - decreases selected detail

With a lot of creativity, different complex structures can be created, such as in the following examples:
